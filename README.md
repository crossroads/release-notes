# Release Note Generator

This command line utility will generate release notes based on the commit messages

## How it works

It will

- Compare the live and master branches
- Find JIRA ticket references in the commits
- Fetch the JIRA ticket titles from JIRA
- Generate a Markdown list of all the tickets that have been affected

The generator will try it's best to determine the name of the project based on any `package.json` file or the git repo url. That can be overriden using the `--app-name <name>` option

## Advanced features

### Generating a PDF

The `--pdf` option can be used to generate a pdf file with all the release notes in it

### Copying to the clipboard

If the `--clipboard` option is present, the markdown will be copied to your clipboard

### Emailing the release notes

If the `--email-to` option is present, it will email the notes using sendgrid. _An api key is required_

e.g `--email-to "email@host.com,email2@host.com"`

The subject of the mail can be overriden using `--email-subject "Mail Subject"`

### Speficiying the commits to compare

By default, the generator will try to compare the `origin/master` branch to the `origin/live` branch.

That can be overriden to point to another branch or commit sha using the `--head <head>` and `--base <base>` options.

This is useful when hooking it up to github actions, the `pull_request` type provides variables such as `${{github.event.pull_request.head.sha}}` which can be used.


## Running the utility

## Github action sample

Example: This will trigger a release email when a branch is merged into the `live` branch

```yaml
# This workflow will do a clean install of node dependencies, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions
